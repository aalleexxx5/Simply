echo Echo Example
set a 10
echo Does variable a say *a
echo good, can I then add an ! directly after *a _ !
echo Nice! what about/newlineadding lines? _ /newline _ is that possible?

set a now let's see
set b if everything works with set as well
echo *a
echo *b
set c and if I can add stuff together
set d seamlessly
echo *c *d _ !
